# State of research

Teaching and classroom management are multidimensional settings in which teachers have to respond immediately to events as they develop [@barnes2004significance]. The different interests and abilities of students must be managed in a way that maximizes the active learning time of students and minimizes disruptions whilst teaching. Learning to develop such classroom management skills and to teach effectively is a complicated and complex process [@wolff2017see]. 

During teaching, teachers must be able to select from a variety of visual and acoustic impressions to focus their attention on the essential and to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant events. This ability is called professional vision and is a key component of teacher expertise and successful teaching [@barth2017professionelle]. Eye tracking technology has become a reliable means to study teachers’ visual focus of attention [@pouta2020student; @bogert2016visualperception; @wolff2017see]

Educational research has repeatedly shown that there are differences between experienced and novice teachers in terms of perception and behavioral competencies [@barth2017professionelle; @bogert2016visualperception; @wolff2017see]. For example, experts direct their attention more often and more evenly to all students, whereas novices only direct their attention to some students. The frequency and duration of fixations as eye movement are decisive [@stuermer2017eye]. Mobile eye-tracking technology has also shown that experienced teachers distribute their focus more efficiently to solve tasks [@jarodzka2010eyes]. Furthermore, in contrast to novices, experts are able to focus their attention on the entire class and guide the class while giving feedback to individual students and answering questions [@cortina2015low].



## Research questions

The aim of the study was to investigate whether there are differences in how expert and novice teachers manage scripted classroom disruptions. The disruptions were experimentally varied using a previously written script. Thus, our aim was to find out whether differences in the allocation of attention between expertise groups can be detected in this controlled context.

In order to answer this question, the hypothesis was formulated that teachers with more professional experience not only notice more disruptions but also notice them faster. In the hypothesis, therefore, it is necessary to check what has already been shown in the research literature: In complex teaching situations, experts have a more structured and elaborate professional knowledge than novices in order to perceive and interpret relevant events and to act appropriately [@berliner2001learning; @lachner2016makes].


# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->


## Participants

For the sample recruitment of the subjects (N = 80, experts n = 40, novices n = 40), schools in the city of Leipzig in Saxony were contacted. The institutions as well as the subjects were informed in detail about the aim and intention of the study in advance. Participation in the study was voluntary and only took place after written consent has been given.

```{r demographicspilottable, echo = FALSE}

# prepare data (selected from questionnaire data)
quest.raw.data<-read.table("./data/short_questionnaire_data_2701211.txt", dec=",", sep="\t", header=T) 

# knock out NAs
quest.raw.data <- quest.raw.data  %>% filter(
  personID != "NA")

# create a basic table (tibble) using tidyverse functions
demo.quest.table <- quest.raw.data %>%
  filter(what == "head") %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(N=n(),
            "Male" = sum(gender),
            "M age" = round(mean(age), 2),
            "Min age" = min(age),
            "Max age" = max(age),
            "SD age" = round(sd(age), 2),
            "M exp." = round(mean(experience), 2),
            "Min exp." = min(experience),
            "Max exp." = max(experience),
            "SD exp." = round(sd(experience), 2),
           )

# format and insert table in manuscript
apa_table(
  demo.quest.table,
  caption = "Demographic Information and Teaching Experience",
  # note = "Write Note here", 
  escape = TRUE, # if TRUE special Latex characters are escaped; if this is turned to F captions cannot be rendered. I don't know why...
  placement = "h", # position of table in page:  exact location (h), at the top (t), bottom (b)
  font_size = "small" # options are tiny, scriptsize, footnotesize, small, normalsize (default), large, Large, LARGE, huge, Huge
  )

```

The selection of the subjects was based on extreme groups, whereby professional experience is the crucial criterion for the selection of experts or novices. Novices were recruited as student teachers, whereas experts were considered to have professional experience  [@messner2000berufliche].

## Procedure/ Data collection

### Set up

The implementation of the study was composed of two parts, which took about 2 hours.

In the first part, the subject teached a ten-minute lesson that has been prepared by him-/herself beforehand. During the lesson, three actors represented the class and simulated typical classroom events.

In order to obtain data, four cameras (GoPro Hero 7) were set up in the room to film the events from different perspectives. The teacher wore mobile eye-tracking glasses to capture the gaze behavior (Tobii Glasses 2). Other classroom sounds and voices were recorded with an audio recorder (Zoom H3-VR Audio-Recorder). 
After the lesson, all participants received a short questionnaire about the teacher's classroom management.

In a second part of the study, the teacher watched the recorded eye-tracking video with . The speech was recorded by the audio recorder. Finally, the subject answered a questionnaire in which he/she had to evaluate various teaching scenarios.

(ref:datacollection-caption) Example for set up during a mini-lesson

```{r datacollection, fig.cap = "(ref:datacollection-caption)", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("./pictures/datacollection.png", dpi = 108)

# # How to insert images in papaja
# - pictures must be png
# - I created a pictures folder in the main folder, just dumb pictures there
# - you just need to hand the name and path of the picture to the knitr::: function (see above)
# - the dpi argument is for adjusting the size on the page in pixels

# in order to write the caption, you have to use the line just above the code chunk (ref:YOURTEXT-caption) and then just write behind it
# the code chunk then opens and after "r" it needs to provide a name for the code chunk, must be unique in the document
# the fig.cap = then calls the text from the line just above
# fig.align allows to position the pic on page, center ist probablby best
# echo = false ensures that the code chunk does not occur in the pdf
# Now, go and try putting your own images in the paper 
#
# TIP = check line 46 in this manuscript. THis section ets global properties for how graphs are put in the paper. 
#         if floatsintext      : yes  --> pics, graphs, tables will be put where the code chunk is
#         if floatsintext      : no   --> pics, graphs, tables will be put at the end as is required by some journals
# TIP: check the folder "papaja_example&tutorial" that I put in this folder for paper1
# Tip: make a bookmark of this and skim through it: http://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/

### Eye tracking data

Eye tracking data was obtained ... 


## Coding/ Data preparation/ Reliability 

The recorded lessons were coded in a post-hoc procedure with the eye tracking analyzer software Tobii Pro Lab by previously trained raters [@kuckartz2019analyzing]. The coding manual of the ProVisioNET study was used to manually code the eye movement and behavior patterns of the subjects. The scripted events, the teacher's first visible reaction to scripted events, and the teacher's gaze points in Areas of Interests (AOIs) were coded. 

The scripted events are coded as event sampling. In the Tobii Pro Lab analyzer software, these events are marked as Time of Interests (TOI) with an end and start time. At the beginning of the coding, the TOIs have to be created in the software for all codes. For the creation of TOIs using events, see Supplement 1.1 Notes on working with Tobii Pro Lab for the creation of TOIs. The entire coding scheme is presented in the appendix.

The coding of the teacher's responses to scripted events is also done as event sampling in Tobii Pro Lab, but only the onset of a reaction due to difficulties to set the offset of a reaction.

To analyze gaze points in the AOIs, areas relevant to the research question must be defined in the Tobii Pro Lab software. For how AOIs are set and manually coded, see Supplement 5 Coding with AOIs.
