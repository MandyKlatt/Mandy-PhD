Workflow for synchronizing and editing video and audio files (gopro, ambient and eye-tracking)

Editing program: Davinci Resolve

before editing the videos
- install Davinci Resolve 16 (not Studio)
- make sure that you have exported the eye-tracking videos with GAZE in Tobii Pro Lab

1) open the program
2) create a new project (name them after the files)

3) media pool opens automatically --> import files (drag-and-drop): 
	- eye-tracking video with gaze (1x)
	- gopro videos (4x)
	- ambient audio recorder (1x)

4) go to "edit" in the bar below
5) drag and drop the videos in each line 
6) check for clapping hands in the beginning
7) cut the videos at this point 
8) ckeck if glasses and gopro videos are synced by audio 
9) cut the end of the videos to make them the same length
10) put all five videos in a row of track 1 with audio track

11) go to "deliver" in the bar below
12) name the file (e.g. Aperol_pilot_02_03_novice_C_cam1_cut) and browse for location
13) change "format" from "Quicktime" to "mp4" and make sure that the codec is "H.264"
14) ! change: render --> "entire timeline" to "in/out range" just above the videos
15) right click on the first video --> render this clip
16) make sure that the video and the filename are the same 
17) click on the left side "add to render queue"
18) video apprears on the right side 
19) click on second video and repeat step 16 and 17
20) do this for all videos in the render bar
21) go to the render queue on the left side and select all videos (strg + clicking on each video) 
22) click "start render" --> wait until it's done

before creating a splitscreen:
- make sure that you have downloaded the splitscreen templates (https://bit.ly/MrAT-SplitScreen)

23) create a splitscreen with glasses video and cam4 or cam3 (a video where you can see the instructions appearing)
24) go back to "edit" 
25) delete the other videos (cam1, cam2, cam3) - keep the audio track 
26) click on "inspector" --> "generator" and "splitX2Horiz"
27) drag the splitscreen in a video track line 
28) adjust the two videos with "transform" and "crop" just below the timeline window (glasses video in upper area and cam4 below)
29) go to "deliver" 
30) name the file (e.g. Aperol_pilot_02_03_novice_C_splitscreen)
31) change "format" from "Quicktime" to "mp4" and make sure that the codec is "H.264"
32) click "add to render queue" on the left side
33) keep "render --> entire timeline"
34) video apprears on the right side 
35) click "start render" --> wait until it's done
