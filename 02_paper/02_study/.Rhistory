# # How to insert images in papaja
# - pictures must be png
# - I created a pictures folder in the main folder, just dumb pictures there
# - you just need to hand the name and path of the picture to the knitr::: function (see above)
# - the dpi argument is for adjusting the size on the page in pixels
# in order to write the caption, you have to use the line just above the code chunk (ref:YOURTEXT-caption) and then just write behind it
# the code chunk then opens and after "r" it needs to provide a name for the code chunk, must be unique in the document
# the fig.cap = then calls the text from the line just above
# fig.align allows to position the pic on page, center ist probablby best
# echo = false ensures that the code chunk does not occur in the pdf
# Now, go and try putting your own images in the paper
