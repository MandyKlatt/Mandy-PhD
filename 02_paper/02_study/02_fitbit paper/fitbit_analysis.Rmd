Get Data from Fitbit

```{r}
data_path <- "./data/heart_rate_data"

main <-
map(.x = dir(path = data_path,
             pattern = ".csv"),
    ~ read_csv(file.path(data_path, .), id = "id") %>% 
      mutate(time = .$Time - min(.$Time),
             heart_rate = `Heart Rate`,
             ID = id,
             time_span = case_when(
               str_detect(string = id, pattern = "_a") ~ "after",
               str_detect(string = id, pattern = "_m") ~ "main",
               str_detect(string = id, pattern = "_p") ~ "pre"
               ),
             ID = str_extract(string = ID,
                              pattern = "[:digit:]{3}"),
             ID = as.numeric(ID)
      ) %>% 
    select(!c("Time","Heart Rate","id"))
    ) %>% 
  bind_rows()

main <-
  left_join(main, df_merge,
            by = "ID")
```

 Check for disruptive factor
 
```{r}
df_rating %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(disruption_factor,
                        na.rm = TRUE
                        )
            ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mean)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

confidence

```{r}
df_merge %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(confident_factor,
                        na.rm = TRUE
                        )
            ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mean)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Age

```{r}
df_merge %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

df_merge %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = log(age))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)
```

```{r}
df_merge %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = teaching_experience)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)

df_merge %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = log(teaching_experience))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.3)
```

Just curious

```{r}
df_merge %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% 
  summarize()
```
