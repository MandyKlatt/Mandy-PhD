\section{Present investigation}\label{present-investigation}

The aim was to investigate whether HR measures assessed by a Fitbit
Charge 4 are a suitable and effective method to \textbf{(1)} map
teachers course of arousal over the course of a five phase lab study,
including a micro teaching unit, and \textbf{(2)} examine whether HR
measures can be predicted by self-reported data on cognitive appraisal.

Within the time frame of approximately two hours, we investigated five
intervals with a duration of 10-minutes each: In the (1) pre-teaching
phase, the subjects were prepared for the following micro teaching unit
teaching lesson and familiarized with the setting. During the (2)
teaching phase, the participants taught a 15-minute self-prepared lesson
to a ``class'' of three actors that simulated nine classroom disruptions
. In the following (3) post-teaching phase, the subjects answered a
questionnaires, followed by and in the (4) interview phase, in which
they subjects watched thea pre-recorded video of their 15-minute lesson
to assess the self-report data of how disrupted subjects felt and how
confident they felt in dealing with disruptions. In the (5) end phase,
the subject answered another second questionnaire.

According to previous findings that fitness trackers can be used as a
low-cost, non-invasive method of measuring HR
\citep{hajj2022wrist, fuller2020reliability} and that different HRs of
teachers can be measured in different teaching phases
\citep{donker2020associations, junker2021potential}, we formulate the
hypotheses as follows:

\textbf{Hypothesis 1}. In a first step, we wanted to display
exploratively the course of HR during the entire study. Additionally, we
presumed the highest mean HR in the (2) teaching phase and lower mean
values in all other phases (\textbf{Hypothesis 1a}). Moreover, we
expected an increase in HR in the (1) pre-teaching phase as the first
phase and a decrease in the following phases (\textbf{Hypothesis 1b}).
\textbf{Hypothesis 2}. We statistically predicted the subjects'
standardized mean HR for the (2) teaching, the (3) post-teaching, the
(4) interview and the (5) end phase with teaching experience and
self-repoted data on \ldots. With respect to teaching experience, Wwe
expected a lower HR in teachers with more teaching experience for the
four phases (\textbf{Hypothesis 2a}). According to the relationship
between physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal, we controlled for
shared variance with the self-reported data. Concerning the \ldots, Wwe
expected higher HR values for for the four phases that teachers who
reported that they felt more disrupted by disruptions would have higher
standardized mean HR (\textbf{Hypotheses 2b}). In contrast, individuals
with high confidence in dealing with disruptions would have a lower
standardized mean HR in the four phases (\textbf{Hypothesis 2c}). When
considering the three predictors in concert and controlling for their
common variance, we expected teaching experience and self-reported data
to remain substantial predictors (\textbf{Hypothesis 2d}).
