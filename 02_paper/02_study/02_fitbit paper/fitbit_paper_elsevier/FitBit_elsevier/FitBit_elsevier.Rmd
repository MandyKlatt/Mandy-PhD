# Present investigation 
The aim was to investigate whether HR measures assessed by a Fitbit Charge 4 are a suitable and effective method to **(1)** map teachers course of arousal over the course of a five phase lab study, including a micro teaching unit,  and **(2)**  examine whether HR measures can be predicted by self-reported data on cognitive appraisal.

Within the time frame of approximately two hours, we investigated five intervals with a duration of 10-minutes each: In the (1) pre-teaching phase, the subjects were prepared for the following micro teaching unit  teaching lesson and familiarized with the setting. During the (2) teaching phase, the participants taught a 15-minute self-prepared lesson to a "class" of three actors that simulated nine classroom disruptions . In the following (3) post-teaching phase, the subjects answered a questionnaires, followed by  and in the (4) interview phase, in which they subjects watched thea pre-recorded video of their 15-minute lesson to assess the self-report data of how disrupted subjects felt and how confident they felt in dealing with disruptions. In the (5) end phase, the subject answered another second questionnaire.

According to previous findings that fitness trackers can be used as a low-cost, non-invasive method of measuring HR [@hajj2022wrist; @fuller2020reliability] and that different HRs of teachers can be measured in different teaching phases [@donker2020associations; @junker2021potential], we formulate the hypotheses as follows:

**Hypothesis 1**. In a first step, we wanted to display exploratively  the course of HR during the entire study.  Additionally, we presumed the highest mean HR in the (2) teaching phase and lower mean values in all other phases (**Hypothesis 1a**). Moreover, we expected an increase in HR in the (1) pre-teaching phase as the first phase and a decrease in the following phases (**Hypothesis 1b**).
**Hypothesis 2**. We statistically predicted  the subjects‚Äô standardized mean HR for the (2) teaching, the (3) post-teaching, the (4) interview and the (5) end phase with teaching experience and self-repoted data on ‚Ä¶.  With respect to teaching experience, Wwe expected a lower HR in teachers with more teaching experience for the four phases (**Hypothesis 2a**). According to the relationship between physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal, we controlled for shared variance with the self-reported data. Concerning the ‚Ä¶, Wwe expected higher HR values for for the four phases that teachers who reported that they felt more disrupted by disruptions would have higher standardized mean HR  (**Hypotheses 2b**). In contrast, individuals with high confidence in dealing with disruptions would have a lower standardized mean HR in the four phases (**Hypothesis 2c**). When considering the three predictors in concert and controlling for their common variance, we expected teaching experience and self-reported data to remain substantial predictors (**Hypothesis 2d**).
