# Introduction
Physiological data such as heart rate are becoming increasingly important in research on stress experience. They represent an important indicator of physical or emotional stress, as increased workload is associated with increased heart rate [@sachs2014physiologische]. Furthermore, they allow a more objective recording of stress than self-reports [@rungeusing]. However, capturing heart rate in an educational context requires the use of low-cost and non-invasive instruments. Fitness trackers worn on the wrist have the potential to be such a useful tool [@ferguson2015validity].

To date, there is still little evidence on the usefulness of heart rate measurements using fitness trackers in teaching and learning settings [@ertzberger2016use; @lowe2016educational]. @rungeusing alone examined teacher stress in a relatively small sample (*N* = 4 teachers) and showed that high heart rate, high step count, and little sleep indicate more stress in teachers.

Thus, there remains a lack of robust studies on whether fitness trackers are an efficient, inexpensive, and robust measurement method for assessing teachers' experience of stress. Since, among other things, greater professional experience is associated with lower feelings of stress in the teaching profession [@fisher2011factors], this study will also consider the heart rate measurements of experienced and inexperienced teachers.
 

## Aim of the study
Against this background, we investigated whether heart rate measurements using fitness trackers in a controlled teaching-learning setting are suitable to map differences between (1) anticipation, arousal, and rest phases. We expected heart rates to be higher in the arousal phase than in the rest phases.


# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Participants

# creating new column with total participants to calculate percent of gender

  mutate(sum_participants = sum(n()))


# create a basic table (tibble) using tidyverse functions
df_demo_table <- df_demo %>%
  summarise(N=n(),
            "Gender female in percent" = round(sum(gender/sum_participants) * 100,
                                               digits = 2),

The sample consisted of *N* = `r length(df_demo$ID)` participants. Data of two participants were excluded from the analyses due to insufficient data quality. 

The subjects (`r df_demo %>% filter(gender == 1) %>% pull(gender) %>% length()` women; `r df_demo_table %>% pull("Gender female in percent")` %) had a mean age of `r df_demo %>% pull(age) %>% mean() %>% round(., digits = 1)` years (*SD* = `r df_demo_table %>% pull("SD Age in years") %>% round(., digits = 1)`; range: `r df_demo_table %>%  pull("Min Age in years")`-`r df_demo_table %>% pull("Max Age in years")`) and an average teaching experience of `r df_demo_table %>% pull("M Teaching Experience in years")` years (*SD* = `r df_demo_table %>% pull("SD Teaching Experience in years")`; range: `r df_demo_table %>% pull("Min Teaching Experience in years")`-`r df_demo_table %>% pull("Max Teaching Experience in years")`). 



## Material
We used a Fitbit Charge 4 to measure the teachers' heart rate. The device was attached 2-finger widths above the ulnar styloid process to the subject‚Äôs wrist following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. To determine the heart rate, the Fitbit flashes green LEDs many times per second and uses light-sensitive photodiodes to measure the volume changes in the capillaries and then calculates how many times the heart beats per minute (bpm). Data were automatically wireless synced with an iPad via Bluetooth to a Fitbit account, and subsequently, the intraday second-by-second data were exported for each session using the opensource software Pulse Watch (PulseWatch. URL: https://iccir919.github.io/pulseWatch/public/index.html [accessed 2022-08-03]).


## Procedure
In a laboratory setting, three trained actors performed teaching disruptions in a counter balanced fashion while the subject taught a 15-minute micro-teaching unit prepared in advance. To record the subject's heart rate, the Fitbit Charge 4 was put on at least 10 minutes before the start of the lesson. The lesson was recorded by four cameras and an audio recorder. In addition, the subject wore eye-tracking glasses to record gaze behavior. 

Subsequently, the subjects as well as the actors were given a short questionnaire, which contained items to collect demographic information as well as items about the previously given lesson on teaching quality using a validated questionnaire (EMU, @helmke2014unterrichtsdiagnostik) and self developed scales on the teacher's presence behavior derived from the research literature via the online survey website SoSci Survey (4-point Likert scale; 1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = agree; 4 = strongly agree). The completion of the questionnaire took approximately 5 minutes. 

The experimenter then conducted a Stimulated Recall Interview (SRI), where the subject commented and rated the reactions to classroom events while watching the eye tracking video.

Finally, a Situational Judgment Test (SJT, @gold2015development) was used to assess the subject's strategic knowledge of classroom management. The subject was asked to judge alternative actions on school scenarios on a 6-point rating scale from 1 (A) to 6 (F) according to school grades. Data from the SJT were again collected as an online questionnaire via the website www.soscisurvey.de and lastet approximately 10 minutes. 

The Fitbit watch was removed only after the last questionnaire to obtain heart rate at three different measurement time points: before, during, and after the lesson. 

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.

### FitBit

All participants were given a FitBit Smart Watch Charge 4 to wear during the experiment. 

## Heart Rate

The heart rate of each subject were measured before, during and after the experiment.

### Steps

Using the FitBit we measured the steps a person walked during the experiment as well. We validated the steps in six randomly selected videos by manual step counting. A step was considered to be the movement of the subject's foot forward, backward, or sideways. The measurement was not as reliable as hoped.

```{r}
# df_steps <- read_rds(file = "data/steps.rds")
# set.seed(5678)
# ggplot(data = df_steps,
#        mapping = aes(x = type,
#                      y = Steps
#                      )
#        ) +
#   geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(color = type),
#                fill = "grey",
#                alpha = 0.6) +
#   geom_jitter(mapping = aes(color = type),
#               alpha = 0.9,
#               width = 0.3) +
#   scale_color_viridis_d(option = "A",
#                        end = 0.8) +

#         legend.title = element_blank(),
#         axis.text.x = element_blank(),
#         axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
#         )
# 
# ### Validation of steps

# 
# # random ID Output:
# # Novices ID: 102, 125, 110
# # Experts ID: 219, 218, 214
# 
# # Results from manual step counting:
# # Novices ID: 110 -> 178 steps; 102 -> 219 steps; 125 -> 319 steps
# # Experts ID: 214 -> 437 steps; 218 -> 195 steps; 219 -> 530 steps
