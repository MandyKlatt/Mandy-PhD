# Introduction

- wie wird Störung definiert
- 

Managing classroom disruptions is a crucial aspect of effective classroom management (@evertson2006classroom; @kounin2006techniken).

Accordingly, teachers must be able to quickly notice and appropriately react to significant events in the classroom. This ability is referred to as classroom professional vision (@goodwin2015professional; @sherin2007development).

The process of professional vision can be divided into two main aspects: focusing on relevant situations for learning and teaching (“noticing”) and applying knowledge to draw appropriate conclusions in these situations (“knowledge-based reasoning”; @seidel2014modeling). 

Therefore, the early visual perception of classroom disruptions is a key component to effectively maximize students’ learning time and minimize classroom interruptions. According to Kounin (2006), these important classroom management strategies are called “withitness” and “overlapping” and can be summarized under the concept of monitoring (@gold2017using). 

Learning to develop such classroom management skills is a demanding and complex task for student teachers (@wolff2016teacher). Research on teacher expertise showed that expert and novice teachers differ in their ability to perceive classroom events, “[…] whereas only a few studies have focused on the basal process of noticing, i.e. the recognition of possible disturbing situations” (@grub2020process, p.75). Mobile eye-tracking data can fill this research gap by providing new insights in how expertise differences in teacher´s professional vision manifest in teacher-student interactions (@lachner2016makes; @@wolff2016teacher).

# Research Questions

This study examined how the degree of teaching experience influences (a) the number of fixations on relevant areas (e.g., the student performing the disruption), (b) the fixation duration in relevant areas and (c) the time to first fixation on relevant areas, using mobile eye-tracking data in a controlled, micro-teaching setting. Based on the existing literature, we expect expert teachers to outperform novices by (H1) showing more fixations on relevant areas with (H2) shorter fixation durations and (H3) perceiving classroom disruptions faster (cf. @van2014first).

The sample consists of *N* = `r length(demo.data$Group)` participants with *n* = `r length(demo.data$Group[demo.data$Group == "Expert"])` expert teachers and *n* = `r length(demo.data$Group[demo.data$Group == "Novice"])` novice teachers. 

The inclusion criterion for experts was that they have successfully completed teacher training and are actively employed in the teaching profession. Novices were student teachers who have already successfully completed their first internship in a school and have gained one to four hours of teaching experience.

The subjects were primarily recruited through personal contacts, social media (facebook), e-mail distribution lists and advertising in lectures at the University Leipzig.

The expert teachers (`r demo.data %>% filter(Gender == 1 & Group == "Expert") %>% pull(Gender) %>% length()` women; `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull("Gender female in percentage")`%) had a mean age of `r demo.data %>% filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull(Age) %>% mean() %>% round(., digits = 1)` years (*SD* = `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull("SD Age in years") %>% round(., digits = 1)`; range: `r demo.table %>%  filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull("Min Age in years")`-`r demo.table %>%  filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull("Max Age in years")`) and an average teaching experience of `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull("M Exp. in years") %>% mean() %>% round(., digits = 1)` years (*SD* = `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull("SD Exp. in years") %>% round(., digits = 1)`; range: `r demo.table %>%  filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull("Min Exp. in years")`-`r demo.table %>%  filter(Group == "Expert") %>% pull("Max Exp. in years")`).

The novice teachers (`r demo.data %>% filter(Gender == 1 & Group == "Novice") %>% pull(Gender) %>% length()` women; `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("Gender female in percentage")`%) had a mean age of `r demo.data %>% filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull(Age) %>% mean() %>% round(., digits = 1)` years (*SD* = `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("SD Age in years") %>% round(., digits = 1)`; range: `r demo.table %>%  filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("Min Age in years")`-`r demo.table %>%  filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("Max Age in years")`) with an average teaching experience of `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("M Exp. in years") %>% mean() %>% round(., digits = 1)` years. On average, the student teachers were in their `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("M Semester") %>% mean() %>% round(., digits = 1)` semester (*SD* = `r demo.table %>% filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("SD Semester") %>% round(., digits = 1)`; range: `r demo.table %>%  filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("Min Semester")`-`r demo.table %>%  filter(Group == "Novice") %>% pull("Max Semester")`).
