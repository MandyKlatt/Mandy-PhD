# State of research

Teaching and classroom management are multidimensional settings in which teachers have to respond immediately to events as they develop [@barnes2004significance]. The different interests and abilities of students must be managed in a way that maximizes the active learning time of students and minimizes disruptions whilst teaching. Learning to develop such classroom management skills and to teach effectively is a complicated and complex process [@wolff2017see]. 

During teaching, teachers must be able to select from a variety of visual and acoustic impressions to focus their attention on the essential and to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant events. This ability is called professional vision and is a key component of teacher expertise and successful teaching [@barth2017professionelle]. Eye tracking technology has become a reliable means to study teachers’ visual focus of attention [@pouta2020student; @bogert2016visualperception; @wolff2017see]

Educational research has repeatedly shown that there are differences between experienced and novice teachers in terms of perception and behavioral competencies [@barth2017professionelle; @bogert2016visualperception; @wolff2017see]. For example, experts direct their attention more often and more evenly to all students, whereas novices only direct their attention to some students. The frequency and duration of fixations as eye movement are decisive [@stuermer2017eye]. Mobile eye-tracking technology has also shown that experienced teachers distribute their focus more efficiently to solve tasks [@jarodzka2010eyes]. Furthermore, in contrast to novices, experts are able to focus their attention on the entire class and guide the class while giving feedback to individual students and answering questions [@cortina2015low].



## Research questions

The aim of the pilot study was to investigate whether there are differences in how expert and novice teachers manage scripted classroom disruptions. The disruptions were experimentally varied using a previously written script. Thus, our aim was to find out whether differences in the allocation of attention between expertise groups can be detected in this controlled context.

In order to answer this question, the hypothesis was formulated that teachers with more professional experience not only notice more disruptions but also notice them faster. In the hypothesis, therefore, it is necessary to check what has already been shown in the research literature: In complex teaching situations, experts have a more structured and elaborate professional knowledge than novices in order to perceive and interpret relevant events and to act appropriately [@berliner2001learning; @lachner2016makes].


# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->


## Participants

For the sample recruitment of the subjects (N = 8, experts n = 2, novices n = 6), schools in the city of Leipzig in Saxony were contacted. The institutions as well as the subjects were informed in detail about the aim and intention of the study in advance. Participation in the study was voluntary and only took place after written consent has been given.

```{r demographicspilottable, echo = FALSE}

# prepare data (selected from questionnaire data)
quest.raw.data<-read.table("./data/short_questionnaire_data_2701211.txt", dec=",", sep="\t", header=T) 

# knock out NAs
quest.raw.data <- quest.raw.data  %>% filter(
  personID != "NA")

# create a basic table (tibble) using tidyverse functions
demo.quest.table <- quest.raw.data %>%
  filter(what == "head") %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(N=n(),
            "Male" = sum(gender),
            "M age" = round(mean(age), 2),
            "Min age" = min(age),
            "Max age" = max(age),
            "SD age" = round(sd(age), 2),
            "M exp." = round(mean(experience), 2),
            "Min exp." = min(experience),
            "Max exp." = max(experience),
            "SD exp." = round(sd(experience), 2),
           )

# format and insert table in manuscript
apa_table(
  demo.quest.table,
  caption = "Demographic Information and Teaching Experience",
  # note = "Write Note here", 
  escape = TRUE, # if TRUE special Latex characters are escaped; if this is turned to F captions cannot be rendered. I don't know why...
  placement = "h", # position of table in page:  exact location (h), at the top (t), bottom (b)
  font_size = "small" # options are tiny, scriptsize, footnotesize, small, normalsize (default), large, Large, LARGE, huge, Huge
  )

```

The selection of the subjects was based on extreme groups, whereby professional experience is the crucial criterion for the selection of experts or novices. Novices were recruited as teachers who have been working in the teaching profession for no more than 3 years, whereas experts were considered to have professional experience of 10 years or more [@messner2000berufliche].

## Procedure/ Data collection

### Set up

For this study, scripted mini-lessons with n = 2 experts and n = 6 novices were recorded in the mobile Lab of the Empirical School and Classroom Research at the University of Leipzig. The subjects were divided into groups of four, so the study was conducted on two different sessions. All participants were asked to hold a 10-minute lesson. The duration of each appointment was approximately 2h: per group 10min briefing, 4 x 10min mini-lessons, 10min technical preparation and follow-up and 4x 10min transition points between the lessons and answering questionnaires.

One person from the group of 4 acted as a teacher, the other three subjects acted as the class. The subjects, who represented the class, were given behavioral instructions in a pre-written script to simulate typical events and disruptions in the classroom (e.g. putting their heads on the table, chatting, looking at their mobile phones, etc.).

The lesson disruptions were displayed as instructions during the lesson for all "students" but not the teacher. In order to avoid learning effects, the disruptions in each lesson were distributed pseudo-randomly over the short teaching phase. In addition, the order of the data collection was taken into account in the analyses and variance caused by order was controlled.

(ref:datacollection-caption) Example for set up during a mini-lesson

```{r datacollection, fig.cap = "(ref:datacollection-caption)", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("./pictures/datacollection.png", dpi = 108)

# # How to insert images in papaja
# - pictures must be png
# - I created a pictures folder in the main folder, just dumb pictures there
# - you just need to hand the name and path of the picture to the knitr::: function (see above)
# - the dpi argument is for adjusting the size on the page in pixels

# in order to write the caption, you have to use the line just above the code chunk (ref:YOURTEXT-caption) and then just write behind it
# the code chunk then opens and after "r" it needs to provide a name for the code chunk, must be unique in the document
# the fig.cap = then calls the text from the line just above
# fig.align allows to position the pic on page, center ist probablby best
# echo = false ensures that the code chunk does not occur in the pdf
# Now, go and try putting your own images in the paper 
#
# TIP = check line 46 in this manuscript. THis section ets global properties for how graphs are put in the paper. 
#         if floatsintext      : yes  --> pics, graphs, tables will be put where the code chunk is
#         if floatsintext      : no   --> pics, graphs, tables will be put at the end as is required by some journals
# TIP: check the folder "papaja_example&tutorial" that I put in this folder for paper1

```

### Behavioral data

The speech, sounds and voices were recorded with an audio recorder installed in the middle of the Lab. Movements, facial expressions and gestures of the subjects were recorded by four cameras from different angles. One camera was installed to film the class from the side. Two more cameras were installed on the blackboard and at the end of the Lab to film the teacher and class from the front and back. Furthermore, the fourth camera was installed in such a way that only facial expressions and gestures of the teacher were recorded, which enables a semi-automated analysis of the movement sequences.


## Coding/ Data preparation/ Reliability 

### Behavioral Data

The recorded lessons were coded in a post-hoc procedure with the coding software MAXQDA by previously trained raters [@kuckartz2019analyzing]. The following coding scheme was developed:

- phase - lesson begin, state event: teacher starts the lesson with a noise, talk, taking a position in class
- phase - lesson end,	state event: teacher finishes the lesson with a noise, talk, taking a position in class
- phase - organization/transition points, state event: any situation that does not imply effective learning time (fetching chalk, working        material, organizing desks, opening windows, printing work results etc.)
- phase - single,	state event: any individual student activity on a given task (reading, writing, drawing etc.)
- phase - group, state event: any student activity on a given task together in a group of at least 3 students (reading, writing, drawing etc.)
- phase - class discussion, state event: discussion in class, teacher talks to class/individual/group
- phase - pair: state event: any student activity on a given task together in a team of 2 students (reading, writing, drawing etc.)
- phase - teachers lecture, state event: any teacher's presentation on a certain topic which maybe supported by a PPP, PREZI, notes on board,    OHP etc.
- phase - other, state event: not categorizable
- phase - break, state event: e.g. drinking, relaxation exercises
- phase - external interruption, state event: external interruptions (e.g. fire alarm, technical problems, other teachers coming into the room)

- speaking time - teacher, state event
- speaking time - students, state event

- disruption - chatting with neighbor, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - asking a question, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - yelling, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - looking at phone, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - staring out of window, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - drawing, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - head on table, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - clicking pen, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - drumming hands, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)
- disruption - walking around, state event (perceived/ not perceived, reacted: verbal, non-verbal/ not reacted)


First, we coded the speaking time of the teacher and the students to compare all perspectives: coder, observer, students, teacher. The graph below shows the result of the coded speaking duration compared to the estimated speaking duration assessed with the questionnaire.
